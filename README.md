# Dashboard

Hi, I'm Jacob! ðŸ‘‹ I would like to introduce you to my app created in react. It enables you to log in to an account by using hard coded email and password without authorization and connection to back-end. After you log in you get to use various widgets such as weather, moon phase, notes/to-do list, calendar.

* If you click an arrow in a widget the five-days forecast will appear. If you want to change the location just click twice on the current one. In the settings you can choose in which scale the temperature will be displayed (Celsius, Kelvins, Fahrenheit)
